# StonybrookCS_FA23
A repository showcasing simple programs in C and OCaml that I wrote in the following courses:
CSE 216 Programming Abstractions (Lambda Calculus and OCaml)
CSE 220 Systems Fundamentals I (C and MIPS Assembly Language)

I try to include only my original code in this repository, and I am open to suggestions and feedback.
Huge thanks to my Professors and fellow students at SUNY Korea for making this possible.
